# ForkliftVR

ForkliftVRSimulator is a virtual reality serious game developed in the Unity Engine. It was designed to teach the basics on forklift operation and our intent while programming this app was to emulate a real forklift certification course.

This repository contains the original scripts and files of the Unity project.
